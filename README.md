# Analyzing-data-on-Nobel-Prize-winners

**The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since
1901. Prizes are awarded annually in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine,
economics and peace. In addition to honour, prestige and a significant amount of prize money, the award
recipient also receives a gold medal bearing the image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who founded the
award. The Nobel Foundation has made available a dataset of all laureates from the awards' inception, 1901
to 2023.**

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Nobel Prize winners' data. The script uses pandas and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
